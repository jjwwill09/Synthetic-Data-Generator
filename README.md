# Synthetic Data Generator

This project is a Python-based application that generates synthetic data from real datasets using machine learning techniques. 
It integrates SDV’s GaussianCopulaSynthesizer for the tabular data generation, while also utilizing a TensorFlow GRU model for realistic name generation. 
The system accommodates multiple formats with an intuitive user interface. 
The goal is to create a tool to generate or enhance a dataset for AI research.
